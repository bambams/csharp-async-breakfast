# csharp-async-breakfast
An over-engineered, asynchronous .NET program (with bugs!) that pretends
to cook breakfast.

The original hack started trying to define the stove and burner and dial
too, but in the interests of time I cut it back to get it "working" and
left the intricate details to imagination...
